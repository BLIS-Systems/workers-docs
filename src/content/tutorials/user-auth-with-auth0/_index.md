In this tutorial, you'll integrate Auth0, an authentication and authorization provider, into a Cloudflare Workers application. Adding authorization and authentication to an application is a common task for developers, and by implementing it using Cloudflare Workers, you can take advantage of Workers' unique platform advantages to simplify how and when your application needs user data.

## What you'll learn

- How to authorize and authenticate users in Workers
- How to persist authorization credentials inside of Workers KV
- How to use Auth0 user info inside of your Workers application

## Prerequisites

To publish your Worker to Cloudflare, you'll need a few things:

- A Cloudflare account, and access to the API keys for that account
- An Auth0 account
- A Wrangler installation running locally on your machine, and access to the command-line

If you don't have those things quite yet, don't worry. We'll walk through each of them and make sure we're ready to go, before you start creating your application.

You'll need to get your Cloudflare API keys to deploy code to Cloudflare Workers: see ["Finding your Cloudflare API keys"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/#configure) for a brief guide on how to find them.

### Configure an Auth0 application

Every Auth0 account contains _applications_, which allow developers to create login/signup flows that are verified by Auth0. Integrating Auth0 with Workers requires creating an application in your Auth0 dashboard; if you've created an account for this tutorial, the "Default (Generic)" application provided by Auth0 will work, otherwise, create a new application with the type "Regular Web Application".

![Creating an application](/tutorials/user-auth-with-auth0/media/creating-an-application.png)

Inside of your application's settings, the client ID and client secret are keys that we'll provide to our Workers application in order to authenticate with Auth0. There are a number of settings and configuration options here, but relevant to this tutorial are the "Allowed Callback URLs" and "Allowed Web Origins" options -- in the "Publish" section of this tutorial, we'll fill in these values with the final deployed URL of our application.

## Generate a new project

Using wrangler's `generate` command, we can begin building a new application using templates provided by the Workers team. For this tutorial, we'll heavily modify the default template for [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites), which deploys a static HTML application:

```sh
$ wrangler generate --site my-auth-example
```

## Building an authorizer

Before we begin implementing an "authorizer" in our application, which will verify that a user is logged in, it's useful to understand how Auth0's login flow works. The condensed version of this flow is below (and, if you're interested, you can [read a longer writeup in Auth0's docs](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/auth-code)):

1. A user makes a request to the Workers application
2. If they aren't logged in, they're redirected to the login page
3. After logging in, they're redirected back to the Workers application, passing a login `code` as a query param
4. The Workers application takes the login `code` parameter, and exchanges it with Auth0 for authorization tokens

In a traditional application that is attached to a database, the authorization tokens returned from Auth0 are often persisted in a database, allowing users to return to the application and continue to use it, without the need for re-authorization. With a Workers application, we have a quick and easy-to-use data storage solution that lives right next to our serverless application: Workers KV. Using Workers KV, we'll store authorization tokens and tie them to a user using an authorization cookie.

![Auth0 Flow](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/media/articles/flows/concepts/auth-sequence-auth-code.png)

### Verifying a user

Let's begin implementing the login flow described in the previous section. When a user makes a request to the Workers application, we should verify that the user is authenticated. To define this logic, create a new file, `workers-site/auth0.js`, which will contain the authorization/verification logic for our application:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

const auth0 = {
  domain: AUTH0_DOMAIN,
  clientId: AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackUrl: AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL
};

const redirectUrl = `${auth0.domain}/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=${auth0.clientId}&redirect_uri=${auth0.callbackUrl}&scope=openid%20profile%20email`;

const verify = async event => {
  // Verify a user based on an auth cookie and KV data
  return { accessToken: "123" };
};

// Returns an array with the format
//   [authorized, context]
export const authorize = async event => {
  const authorization = await verify(event);
  if (authorization.accessToken) {
    return [true, { authorization }];
  } else {
    return [false, { redirectUrl }];
  }
};
```

The `auth0` object wraps a number of secrets, which are encrypted values that can be defined and used by your script. In the "Publish" section of this tutorial, we'll define these secrets using the [`wrangler secret`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/secrets/) command.

The `verify` function, which we'll stub out in our first pass through this file, will check for an authorization key and look up a corresponding value in Workers KV. For now, we'll simply return an object with an `accessToken` string, to simulate an _authorized_ request.

The `authorize` function, which should be exported from `./auth0.js`, will wait for the response from the `verify` function, and return an array that can be used to determine how the application should proceed.

In `workers-site/index.js`, we can import the `authorize` function from `./auth0.js`, and use it inside of our `handleEvent` function. Note that by default, the Workers Sites template contains code for rendering your Workers Site from KV â€“ to keep that code functioning, make sure that you replace `handleEvent` as defined below:

```js
// workers-site/index.js

import { authorize } from "./auth0";

async function handleEvent(event) {
  let request = event.request
  let response
  const url = new URL(request.url)

  try {
    const [authorized, { authorization, redirectUrl }] = await authorize(event);

    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
    // Make sure to not touch this code for the majority of the tutorial!
    response = getAssetFromKV(event)
    // END OF WORKERS SITES

    return response
  } catch (e) {
    return new Response(e.message || e.toString(), { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

The `authorize` function returns an array with a boolean `authorized` and a context object, which will contain either an `authorization` object, or a `redirectUrl`.

Building on the past code sample, we can check that a user is `authorized` and that the `authorization` object contains an `accessToken`, and update the incoming `request` to contain an `Authorization` header:

```js
// workers-site/index.js

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    const [authorized, { authorization, redirectUrl }] = await authorize(event);
    if (authorized && authorization.accessToken) {
      request = new Request(request, {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${authorization.accessToken}`
        }
      });
    }
    // END OF AUTHORIZATION CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
  }
}
```

If a user isn't authorized, we can redirect them to Auth0's login page, by calling `Response.redirect`, passing in the `redirectUrl`:

```js
async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    const [authorized, { authorization, redirectUrl }] = await authorize(event);
    // END OF AUTHORIZATION CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF REDIRECT CODE BLOCK
    if (!authorized) {
      return Response.redirect(redirectUrl);
    }
    // END OF REDIRECT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
  }
}
```

When a user logs in via Auth0's login form, they'll be redirected back to the callback URL specified by your application. In the next section, we'll handle that redirect, and get a user access token as part of the "login" code flow.

![Auth0 Login Form](/tutorials/user-auth-with-auth0/media/auth0-login.png)

### Handling a login redirect

To handle the "login" code flow as defined by Auth0, we'll handle an incoming request to the `/auth` path, which will contain a `code` parameter. By making another API request to Auth0, providing our app's client ID and secret, we can exchange the login code for an access token.

To begin, we'll add a new block of code to `handleEvent`, which will parse the request URL, and if the URL path matches `/auth`, we'll call the newly imported `handleRedirect` function from `./auth0`.

```js
// workers-site/index.js
import { authorize, handleRedirect } from "./auth0";

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    // END OF REDIRECT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF HANDLE AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK
    if (url.pathname === "/auth") {
      const authorizedResponse = await handleRedirect(event);
    }
    // END OF HANDLE AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
  }
}
```

The `handleRedirect` function, which we'll export from `workers-site/auth0.js`, will parse the incoming URL, and pass the `code` login parameter to `exchangeCode`:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

export const handleRedirect = async event => {
  const url = new URL(event.request.url);
  const code = url.searchParams.get("code");
  if (code) {
    return await exchangeCode(code);
  }
  return {};
};
```

Let's define `exchangeCode`, which will take the `code` parameter, and make a request back to Auth0, exchanging it for an access token:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js
const exchangeCode = async code => {
  const body = JSON.stringify({
    grant_type: "authorization_code",
    client_id: auth0.clientId,
    client_secret: auth0.clientSecret,
    code,
    redirect_uri: auth0.callbackUrl
  });

  // We'll define persistAuth in the next section
  return persistAuth(
    await fetch(AUTH0_DOMAIN + "/oauth/token", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
      body
    })
  );
};
```

### Persisting authorization data in KV

The `persistAuth` function, which we'll define next, will handle the request and parse the appropriate authorization info from it. Let's begin by parsing the JSON body returned back from Auth0:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

const persistAuth = async exchange => {
  const body = await exchange.json();

  if (body.error) {
    throw new Error(body.error);
  }

  console.log(body) // { access_token: '...', id_token: '...', ... }
};
```

The `body` object, if it doesn't contain any errors, will contain an `access_token`, `id_token`, and [other fields](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/guides/auth-code/add-login-auth-code#request-tokens) that we should persist inside of Workers KV, a key-value store that we can access inside of our Workers scripts. When we store data inside Workers KV, we need to persist it using a key. The `id_token` field, which is returned by Auth0, is a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) that contains a `sub` field, which is a unique identifier for each user. We'll decode the JSON Web Token, parse it into an object, and use the `sub` field as the key when we write the `body` to Workers KV:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

// https://github.com/pose/webcrypto-jwt/blob/master/workers-site/index.js
const decodeJWT = function(token) {
  var output = token
    .split(".")[1]
    .replace(/-/g, "+")
    .replace(/_/g, "/");
  switch (output.length % 4) {
    case 0:
      break;
    case 2:
      output += "==";
      break;
    case 3:
      output += "=";
      break;
    default:
      throw "Illegal base64url string!";
  }

  // TODO Use shim or document incomplete browsers
  var result = atob(output);

  try {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(result));
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return result;
  }
};

const persistAuth = async exchange => {
  const body = await exchange.json();

  if (body.error) {
    throw new Error(body.error);
  }

  const decoded = JSON.parse(decodeJWT(body.id_token));
  await AUTH_STORE.put(decoded.sub, JSON.stringify(body));
};
```

Once the user's authentication data has been stored in KV, we need to associate the user with that data. To do this, we'll set a cookie, setting the value to the `sub` field we used earlier. This cookie will be used as we fill out the `verify` function defined earlier in the tutorial, and we'll set it to expire in a day (though this is easily customizable to your application's needs). To persist this cookie, we'll return an object containing some data for a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) instance, redirecting the user via an [HTTP 302 response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302) to the `/` path, with a `Set-cookie` header:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

const cookieKey = "AUTH0-AUTH";

const persistAuth = async exchange => {
  const body = await exchange.json();

  if (body.error) {
    throw new Error(body.error);
  }

  const decoded = JSON.parse(decodeJWT(body.id_token));

  await AUTH_STORE.put(decoded.sub, JSON.stringify(body));

  const date = new Date();
  date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1);

  const headers = {
    Location: "/",
    "Set-cookie": `${cookieKey}=${
      decoded.sub
    }; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Expires=${date.toUTCString()}`
  };

  return { headers, status: 302 };
};
```

TODO: the set cookie value here should probably be encrypted.

With our authorization logic defined, we can finally wrap up the corresponding code in `workers-site/index.js`. Knowing that the `handleRedirect` function will pass back an object with `Response` options, we can make a new `Response` object, passing in the information from the existing `response`, and adding the new headers and status code from `handleRedirect`. This will redirect the user to the app's root path, setting a cookie to indicate that they're authorized for future requests:

```js
// workers-site/index.js

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    // BEGINNING OF HANDLE AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK
    if (url.pathname === "/auth") {
      const authorizedResponse = await handleRedirect(event);
      response = new Response(response.body, {
        response,
        ...authorizedResponse
      });
      return response;
    }
    // END OF HANDLE AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
  }
}
```

## Adding the verify read block

With our application persisting authentication data in KV, and associating it to the current user via a cookie, we're now prepared to fill out the `verify` function defined earlier in the tutorial. This function will look at the `Cookie` header, and look up the authentication info that we persisted in Workers KV. The tokens saved in Workers KV can be used to make a subrequest to Auth0, which has the benefit of both re-verifying the user, as well as getting some user info, such as name and email address, if they're provided using the user's authentication method of choice.

To begin, install the NPM package [`cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie), which we'll use to simplify parsing the `Cookie` header in the `request`:

```sh
$ npm install cookie
```

In `workers-site/auth0.js`, we can begin to flesh out the contents of the `verify` function, beginning by parsing the `Cookie` header, looking for our `cookieKey` as defined earlier in the tutorial:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

import cookie from "cookie";

const verify = async event => {
  const cookieHeader = event.request.headers.get("Cookie");
  if (cookieHeader && cookieHeader.includes(cookieKey)) {
    const cookies = cookie.parse(cookieHeader);
    if (!cookies[cookieKey]) return {};
    const sub = cookies[cookieKey];
  }
  return {}
};
```

With the unique ID `sub` parsed from the `Cookie` header, we can use it to retrieve the user information we previously stored in KV:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

const verify = async event => {
  const cookieHeader = event.request.headers.get("Cookie");
  if (cookieHeader && cookieHeader.includes(cookieKey)) {
    const cookies = cookie.parse(cookieHeader);
    if (!cookies[cookieKey]) return {};
    const sub = cookies[cookieKey];

    const kvStored = JSON.parse(await AUTH_STORE.get(sub));
    const { access_token: accessToken, id_token: idToken } = kvStored;
    const decoded = JSON.parse(decodeJWT(idToken));
  }
};
```

Finally, we'll make a subrequest to Auth0's [`/userinfo`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-user-info) endpoint, which will provide some additional user information that we'll make available under the `userInfo` key:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

const verify = async event => {
  const cookieHeader = event.request.headers.get("Cookie");
  if (cookieHeader && cookieHeader.includes(cookieKey)) {
    const cookies = cookie.parse(cookieHeader);
    if (!cookies[cookieKey]) return {};
    const sub = cookies[cookieKey];

    const kvStored = JSON.parse(await AUTH_STORE.get(sub));
    const { access_token: accessToken, id_token: idToken } = kvStored;
    const decoded = JSON.parse(decodeJWT(idToken));

    const resp = await fetch(userInfoUrl, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
    });
    const json = await resp.json();
    if (decoded.sub !== json.sub) {
      throw new Error("Access token is invalid");
    }
    return { accessToken, idToken, userInfo: json };
  }
  return {};
};
```

As a recap, this `verify` function, which we defined earlier in the tutorial, will now correctly verify our application's users based on the `Cookie` field, and make any authorization information available as part of the `authorization` object:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

export const authorize = async event => {
  const authorization = await verify(event);
  if (authorization.accessToken) {
    return [true, { authorization }];
  } else {
    return [false, { redirectUrl }];
  }
};
```

By implementing this function, we've now completed the authorization/authentication portion of the tutorial! Our application will authorize any incoming users, redirecting them to Auth0 and verifying their access tokens, before they're allowed to see our Workers Site content. To configure your deployment, and publish the application, you can skip to the "Publish" section, but in the next few portions of the tutorial, we'll focus on some of the more interesting aspects of this project: using user information in our application, via "edge state hydration", logging out our users, and some improvements and customizations that can be done to this application to make it ready for production usage.

### Using user data in our application

In the previous section of the tutorial, we made a request to Auth0's `/userinfo` endpoint, which provides information such as name and email address for use in our application. Using Workers' [HTML Rewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/html-rewriter/), we can embed the `userInfo` object that we've received from Auth0 directly into our site, by creating an instance of the `HTMLRewriter` class, and attaching a handler `hydrateState` to any found `head` tags that pass through the rewriter. The `hydrateState` handler will add a new `script` tag with an ID of `edge_state`, which we can parse and utilize in any front-end JavaScript code we'll deploy with our application. Instead of simply returning `response` in `handleEvent`, we can replace it with the HTML rewriter code, and return a transformed version of `response`:

```js
const hydrateState = (state = {}) => ({
  element: head => {
    const jsonState = JSON.stringify(state)
    const scriptTag = `<script id="edge_state" type="application/json">${jsonState}</script>`
    head.append(scriptTag, { html: true });
  }
});

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    // END OF WORKERS SITES

    // Remove the line of code below
    // return response

    // BEGINNING OF STATE HYDRATION CODE BLOCK
    return new HTMLRewriter()
      .on("head", hydrateState(authorization.userInfo))
      .transform(response)
    // END OF STATE HYDRATION CODE BLOCK
  }
  // ...
}
```

For a more detailed example of this functionality, check out the [source code](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-auth0-example/) for this tutorial, which shows how to integrate this information using the JavaScript framework Alpine.js. In this example, the `userInfo` object is embedded into the `script#edge_state` tag, and when the site is rendered in the client's browser, the user's name (or email address, if the user's name isn't provided) is displayed:

![User info](/tutorials/user-auth-with-auth0/media/userInfo.png)

### Logging out users

While a user's authentication cookie expires after a day, you may want to offer the ability for a user to log out manually. This is quite simple to implement - instead of letting the cookie expire automatically, your Workers application should pass a `Set-cookie` header that nulls out the `cookieKey` we previously defined. Let's create a `logout` function in `workers-site/auth0.js`, and import it in `workers-site/index.js`, calling it when a user requests `/logout`:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

export const logout = event => {
  const cookieHeader = event.request.headers.get("Cookie");
  if (cookieHeader && cookieHeader.includes(cookieKey)) {
    return {
      headers: {
        "Set-cookie": `${cookieKey}="";`
      }
    };
  }
  return {};
};
```

```js
// workers-site/index.js
import { ..., logout } from './auth0.js'

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    // END OF HANDLE AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF LOGOUT CODE BLOCK
    if (url.pathname === "/logout") {
      const { headers } = logout(event);
      return headers
        ? new Response(response.body, {
            ...response,
            headers: Object.assign({}, response.headers, headers)
          })
        : Response.redirect(url.origin);
    }
    // END OF LOGOUT CODE BLOCK

    // BEGINNING OF STATE HYDRATION CODE BLOCK
  }
}
```

In your Workers Site, you can add a "Log out" link, which will send users to the `/logout` route, and clear their auth cookie via the `Set-cookie` header:

```html
<a href="/logout">Log out</a>
```

Note that by design, the placement of the `LOGOUT CODE BLOCK` in `workers-site/index.js` is placed _after_ the `AUTH REDIRECT CODE BLOCK`. This is intentional: it allows users to continue to your application's deployed Workers Site code, meaning that you can provide a corresponding `logout/index.html` template with a "You're logged out!" message, or something similar. When the user refreshes the page, they'll be identified as an unauthorized user, and be redirected to Auth0's login page. For a more advanced implementation of logout functionality, you may choose to _always_ return a redirect to your app's root path: this will force every user to sign in again immediately after logging in:

```js
// workers-site/auth0.js

export const logout = event => {
  const cookieHeader = event.request.headers.get("Cookie");
  if (cookieHeader && cookieHeader.includes(cookieKey)) {
    return {
      headers: {
        "Location": "/"
        "Set-cookie": `${cookieKey}="";`
      },
      status: 302
    };
  }
  return {};
};
```

### Improvements and customizations

This tutorial provides a good starting point for understanding and implementing authentication in Workers, using Auth0. There's a number of customizations and improvements that can be done to this codebase that are out-of-scope for the purposes of this tutorial, but will be briefly mentioned in this section, along with links to learn more.

#### Deploying to origin/originless

While this tutorial assumes that you're deploying a Workers Sites application, you may want to put this authorization logic in front of an existing domain. This concept, known as deploying to an "origin", is in contrast to the "originless" deploy, where your Workers deployment _is_ the final destination for any requests from users of your application.

The next section of this tutorial, "Publish", assumes deployment to Workers' built-in deployment target, `workers.dev`, but if you want to handle deploying to an existing domain, known commonly as a "zone", you'll need to do the following things:

1. Update the `handleEvent` function to make a request to your origin

While we're currently using Workers Sites, you can update `workers-site/index.js` and replace the Workers Site code with a request to your origin:

```js
// workers-site/index.js

async function handleEvent(event) {
  try {
    // BEGINNING OF WORKERS SITES
    // ^- this can now be thought of as "BEGINNING OF ORIGIN REQUEST"

    // Replace the below line of code
    // response = getAssetFromKV(event)

    // With a fetch request to your origin
    response = await fetch(request)
    // END OF WORKERS SITES
    // ^- this can now be thought of as "END OF ORIGIN REQUEST"
  }
}
```

Given an example configuration and deployment of "https://my-auth.signalnerve.com", your Workers script will continue to authorize users, but when it comes time to return a response back to the user, the code will now make a request to `my-auth.signalnerve.com`, and, if you've set up the "edge state hydration" concept explored earlier in this tutorial, you'll still receive the same user info in your HTML response as originally configured.

2. Configure your `wrangler.toml` to associate your Workers script with a zone

Associating a configured zone from your Cloudflare account has been covered in great detail in the Workers Quick Start guide, specifically the section ["Publish To Your Domain"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart#publish-to-your-domain). In the "Publish" section of this guide, we'll cover how to configure the file `wrangler.toml` to deploy to workers.dev â€“ make sure you read the Quick Start section linked above so you can understand how these approaches differ.

In particular, you'll need to ensure that you have `zone_id` and `route` keys in your `wrangler.toml`, and `workers_dev` disabled. You may also choose to entirely remove the `[site]` block from your `wrangler.toml`, which will stop `wrangler` from uploading the contents of your project's `public` folder to Workers KV:

```toml
# wrangler.toml

workers_dev = false
zone_id = "123abc"
route = "https://my-auth.signalnerve.com/*"

## The below information can be removed
[site]
bucket = "./public"
```

Pay close attention to the `route` field in your `wrangler.toml`, as this determines when your Workers script will run on your zone. For compatibility with the code we've written so far in this tutorial, the wildcard route `/*` should be used, which will match every request to your site and pass it through your Workers script.

Deploying an "origin" version of this code can be a great approach for users who want to utilize this functionality in an existing codebase or site!

#### Using the open-source version of this package

[The open-source example repository for this tutorial](https://github.com/signalnerve/workers-auth0-example/) showcases all the functionality outlined in this tutorial â€“ originless/origin deploys, edge state hydration, and more. If you want to get started with this project, we recommend you check it out!Â 

## Publish

We're finally ready to deploy our application to Workers. Before we can successfully deploy the application, we need to set some configuration values both in Workers and Auth0.

### Creating a KV namespace

In the code for this tutorial, we've used the constant `AUTH_STORE` to refer to a Workers KV namespace where we store authorization info for our users. Before we can deploy this project, we need to create a KV namespace and attach it to our Workers application. Using wrangler, we can create this KV namespace directly from the command-line:

```sh
$ wrangler kv:namespace create AUTH_STORE
```

The output of running that command will be a block of code that you can paste directly into `wrangler.toml`, which will "bind" your new KV namespace to your application. It should look something like this:

```toml
# wrangler.toml

## ...existing wrangler.toml information

kv-namespaces = [
  { binding = "AUTH_STORE", id = "$YOURNAMESPACEID" }

### Secrets

In `workers-site/auth0.js`, we referred to a number of Auth0 constants, such as client ID, secret, and more. Before we can deploy our application, we should set up these secrets, using wrangler's `secret` command, which will make them available to reference as constants in the codebase.

Below is the complete list of secrets that the Workers script will look for when it processes a client request:

| `wrangler secret` key | Value                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTH0_DOMAIN          | Your Auth0 domain (e.g. `myapp.auth0.com`)        |
| AUTH0_CLIENT_ID       | Your Auth0 client ID                              |
| AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET   | Your Auth0 client secret                          |
| AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL    | The callback url for your application (see below) |

For each key, you can find the corresponding value in your Auth0 application settings page, and using `wrangler secret`, you can set it directly in the command-line:

```sh
$ wrangler secret put AUTH0_DOMAIN
$ wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
$ wrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
$ wrangler secret put AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL
```

#### Setting the callback url

In order to correctly set the callback URL for your application, you will need to determine where your application will be deployed. Regardless of whether you're setting up a _originless_ or _origin_-based deploy, the callback handler for this project is defined at `/auth`. This means that if you're testing or deploying a staging version of this project, your callback URL will likely be something like `my-auth-example.signalnerve.workers.dev/auth`, or for production, you should set it to something like `my-production-app.com/auth`.

This tutorial assumes the usage of a `workers.dev` subdomain, which is provided for free to all developers using Workers. You can determine your callback URL by combining the name of your application (chosen during the `wrangler generate` phase -- in this tutorial, we picked `my-auth-example`) and your workers.dev subdomain, as seen below:

```
$applicationName.$subdomain.workers.dev/auth
```

Following this example, the callback URL for my application is `my-auth-test.signalnerve.workers.dev/auth`.

#### Allowed origin/callback URLs

Note that Auth0 has great security defaults, and any callback URLs or origins that you attempt to login from need to be explicitly provided in the Auth0 dashboard as part of your application config. Using the above `workers.dev` example, you should ensure the following values are set in the application settings page of your Auth0 dashboard, along with any additional urls used as part of testing (e.g. `localhost:8787` for [wrangler dev][wrangler dev] usage):

| URL                                          | Description          |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| $applicationName.$subdomain.workers.dev      | Allowed Origin       |
| $applicationName.$subdomain.workers.dev/auth | Allowed Callback URL |

### Configuring `wrangler.toml`

The `wrangler.toml` generated as part of your application tells wrangler how and where to deploy your application. Using the ["Configure" section of the Quick Start](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/#configure) as a guide, populate `wrangler.toml` with your account ID, which will allow you to deploy your application to your Cloudflare account:

```toml
# wrangler.toml

account_id = "$accountId"
```

### Publishing your application

With your `wrangler.toml` successfully configured, you can now use wrangler's `publish` command to deploy your application:

```sh
$ wrangler publish
```

Wrangler will compile your code, upload the associated Workers Sites folder (`public`, by default), and begin handling requests sent to your `workers.dev` application, or to your zone. To confirm everything works as expected, you should:

1. Visit your application (e.g. [my-auth-test.signalnerve.workers.dev](https://my-auth-test.signalnerve.workers.dev)), which should redirect you to Auth0's login page
2. Login with an email/password, or if you've enabled Google, Twitter, or other "social" login providers, the login provider of your choice
3. Watch Auth0 redirect you to `/auth`, and then to `/`. Beneath the hood, your Workers application has exchanged a login `code` with Auth0 for an access token, persisted it to Workers KV, and registered you as an authorized user via a cookie.
4. If you see your site, congrats! You're successfully authorized users to your Workers application, using Auth0.
