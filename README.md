# Cloudflare Workers Documentation

This project contains the static website content for the [Cloudflare Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

## Install

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 10.13.0 or higher

## Preview

To test the content or static gatsby files locally, run:

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

You can now edit the .md (`/src/content`)files and the HTML files will be autogenerated in `./public`.
